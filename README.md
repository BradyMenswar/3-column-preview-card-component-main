## My process

### Built with
- Plain CSS
- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this challenge I was able to test my knowledge of flex-box and create these consecutive cards. This is my first time making a web-page that also has an intended mobile design, so I was also able to learn how I implement different widths and wrapping to have a better user interface for mobile.

### Continued development

I still would like to learn more about mobile design. I did not use any media queries on this webpage, and I think that they could have been implemented to better layout my design.
